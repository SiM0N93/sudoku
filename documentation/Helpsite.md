Sudoku tips & hints

1
Use the counting principles to solve the puzzles. 
Since you already know that you can't have the same number in any row, column, 
or nine-square block, you can use that to help you get a number. 
The difficulty depends on the placement of the numbers given to you.

2
Searching for "definites". When solving an easy Sudoku, 
the first thing you should do is look for definites. Definites are numbers 
that are definitely going to be there. Starting at 1, 
draw imaginary lines through boxes in that 1's row and/or column. 
When there is only one box left in the 3x3 box, you know that is a definite. 

3
Work your way through the numbers until 9. 
Since you have filled in some numbers, this should help get other 
numbers that had more than one possibility before.
