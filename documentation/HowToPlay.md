How to play Sudoku

A sudoku puzzle initially displays a partially filled grid.
The aim of the game is to fill each square with a number from 1 - 9. Each number can only appear once in the same row, column or 3 x 3 box. 
Solving sudoku puzzles takes pure logic, there is no maths involved in finding a solution. Sudoku can be played with 9 different numbers, symbols or images and there is only ever one correct solution.
 
Step 1:
Look at the puzzle and find a mini grid that has lots of hints

Step 2:
Look at each row and columns of the mini grid and fill in the missing numbers. Each number can only be used once!

Step 3:
Look at the columns and rows again. Check to make sure none of the numbers are the same. Move any that are the same.

Step 4:
Do these steps again for each mini grid
